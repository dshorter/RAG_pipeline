# RAG Implementation Project Plan and Priorities

## High Priority Tasks

1. Standardize Configuration Usage
   - Objective: Ensure consistent use of ConfigSingleton across the entire project
   - Steps:
     a. Audit current configuration usage in all files
     b. Refactor code to use ConfigSingleton consistently
     c. Update ConfigSingleton to provide all necessary config values
   - Estimated time: 2-3 days
   - Impact: High (Improves code consistency and maintainability)

2. Process Multiple Documents
   - Objective: Modify pipeline to process all documents in a directory
   - Steps:
     a. Update run_pipeline.py to iterate through a directory
     b. Modify RAGPipeline class to handle multiple documents
     c. Test with a sample directory of documents
   - Estimated time: 1-2 days
   - Impact: High (Enables batch processing of documents)

3. Implement Basic Document Metadata Extraction
   - Objective: Automatically capture basic document metadata
   - Steps:
     a. Research and choose a metadata extraction library
     b. Implement metadata extraction in the document processing step
     c. Update database schema to store additional metadata
   - Estimated time: 2-3 days
   - Impact: Medium (Enhances document information without manual input)

## Medium Priority Tasks

4. Create Consolidated View for Demo
   - Objective: Develop a view showing metadata, chunks, and vectors for demo purposes
   - Steps:
     a. Design the layout for the consolidated view
     b. Implement the view in the Streamlit app
     c. Ensure efficient data loading for large datasets
   - Estimated time: 3-4 days
   - Impact: Medium (Improves demonstration and debugging capabilities)

5. Optimize Performance
   - Objective: Improve processing speed and efficiency
   - Steps:
     a. Profile the current pipeline to identify bottlenecks
     b. Optimize document chunking and embedding generation
     c. Implement batch processing where applicable
   - Estimated time: 5-7 days
   - Impact: High (Improves overall system performance)

## Low Priority Tasks

6. Enhance Error Handling and Logging
   - Objective: Improve system resilience and debugging capabilities
   - Steps:
     a. Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
     b. Enhance logging to capture more detailed information
     c. Create a system for aggregating and analyzing logs
   - Estimated time: 3-4 days
   - Impact: Medium (Improves system reliability and maintainability)

7. Develop Advanced Features
   - Objective: Implement conversation history and dynamic prompt adjustment
   - Steps:
     a. Design the conversation history feature
     b. Implement dynamic prompt adjustment based on context
     c. Integrate these features into the existing pipeline
   - Estimated time: 7-10 days
   - Impact: High (Significantly enhances system capabilities)
