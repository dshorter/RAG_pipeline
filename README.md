# RAG Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Azure OpenAI services and local vector storage with FAISS. It's designed to process documents, generate embeddings, and provide context-aware responses to queries.

## Features
- **Flexible Document Processing**: Efficiently processes and tokenizes various document formats.
- **Smart Chunking**: Implements configurable document chunking with overlaps for context preservation.
- **Dual Embedding Generation**:
  - Azure OpenAI API integration for high-quality embeddings.
  - Fallback to Hugging Face models for offline or cost-effective processing.
- **Efficient Vector Storage**: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search operations.
- **Metadata Management**: SQLite integration for storing and retrieving document metadata.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily configurable through environment variables and config files.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of each pipeline stage for easy debugging and optimization.
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in collection and reporting of key performance indicators.
